== Feature Detection
In this project, we implement Scale Invariant Feature Transform(SIFT) to extract
features. There are 4 main steps of SIFT: build scale space, detect keypoints, 
assign major orientation, feature extraction. There are lots of details to handel
and consider during the implementation. We not only read the course silde, but
the original paper `Distinctive Image Features from Scale-Invariant Keypoints` 
from Lowe. We will discuss each of main steps at the first, and some practical 
issues and the details later.
=== 4 Main Steps
   
 
==== Build Scale Space
To achieve scale invariant, SIFT generates pyramids on different scale 
level. For each level, it interpolates some layers to make the performance
more robust. We use the function  to build them all. We can subject two
consecutive layers to get DoGs for keypoint detection. We do it by GenerateDoG().

==== Detect Keypoint
After building pyramids on different scale level and getting the DoGs, we
treat the local maximum across DoGs as the keypoints. To get a more robust
keypoints, SIFT throws out the low contrast samples and eliminates the
edges. We do it by DetectFeatures(), check_local_maximal() and is_low_contrast_or_edge().

{{ img/sift2.jpg | Detect Keypoint ~||width=25%}}

==== Assign Orientation
For each keypoint, we compute the orientation and magnitude of gradient of
surrounding points. The surrounding window size depends on the value of sigmas.
To avoid biundary case may affect the result too much, SIFT applies a gaussion 
filter on the gradient magnitudes. SIFT splits the orientation angels into 
36 bins, and do weighted voting the determine the major orientation . We do it by
ComputeOrientation().

{{ img/sift3.jpg | Assign Orientation ~||width=30%}}

==== Feature Extraction
SIFT split the surrounding 16*16 windws into 16 4*4 small windows. FOr each
window, it split the angels into 8 bins and do weighted voting on it. Notice 
that the orientation is the relative orientation to the major orientation here.
Hence we can get 16*8 = 128 features at the end. We do it by GenerateFeatures().

=== Some Practical issues and the difficuties we faced

==== Gray scale image
Such feature extraction algorithms can only handle gray scale cases, for RGB
images, it tolds us that is a extended research problems. We are not sure
how this problem is solved. If the features extracted from gray scale is stable,
does it worth to do that?

==== Build Scale on different size 
SIFT applies diiferent sigma on the figure, the effect is equivalent to we
generate diiferent scale images. So each we update the sigma by 
sigma = sigma*pow( 2, 1/S ). However, in practice, we scale the image by 
doubling or halving it in each octaves. And the sigma in each octave is
a fixed sequence, such like 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4 in our implementation. The 
reason is the effect of gaussian filtering is accumulated.

==== Pyramid
By above, we need to doubling or scaling down the image across different 
octaves. To accumulate the effect of gaussian, it can't use the simple 
resize method. Such simple resize method may be bi-linear or tri-linear 
by default in many libraries. The words pyramid implies the gaussian 
filtering.

==== Pre-smoothing
Here are 2 times pre-smoothing in many practical guide ot implementation.
First, before we doubling the original image for the base image in the 
octaves, pre-smooth it. Second, after doubling, pre-smooth it again.
The original paper does not mention the first pre-smoothing stage, but 
the performance is better with 2 stages approaches.

==== Downward parabola fitting for peak detection
As the throwing out low constrast samples in feature detections, for each 
candidate peak( local maximum and magnitude > 0.8*max peak ),we use its
left and right neighbors to fit a downward parabola curve and fin the 
position of maximum peak in that curve.

== The Feature Matching
Here is an example of the feature matching based on the feature extracted 
by our SIFT implementation. The right image is shrinked and rotated from
the left image. We only show the matched points in the figure. The rate of 
mathing is around 60%.

== Stiching
We implemented full recognizing panoroma for stiching. Besides, we also
create a new bundle adjustment algorithm with coordinate descent and
regularized least square. It demos that global bundle adjustment won't 
be the bottleneck of stiching algorithms. Here's the detail:

=== Cylinderal Projection
Before getting features, we use cylinder projection to distort. 
We apply the projection to source images

* \[\theta^\prime = s\theta = s\arctan(x,f)\]
* \[h^\prime = sh = s\frac{y}{\sqrt{x*x+f*f}}\]

with inverse wraping.

Not to scale too much, we make the width after projection fixed and it
leads to the following formula:

* \[f = \frac{\text{width}}{\tan(\tau)}\]
* \[s = \frac{\text{width}}{\tau}\]

in which \(\tau\) is a factor that controls the distortion.

=== Matching
FLANN of Muja[2] is used to perform ANN matching in the SIFT space.

=== Recognizing Panoromas
We implemented Brown[2]. The basic idea is to run RANSAC to identify pairwise connections,
and use a probablistic model inside the RANSAC to decide if a random consensus is good.
After this, we could partition the input images to several connected groups.

==== Feature Selection
First, we use FLANN to choose the first 4 nearest neighbors of each features, 
group them by image indexes pair. For each image, we will choose 6 neighbor
images with the most matched features and drop others. For each image pair, RANSAC
is used to determin inliers of matched features.

==== RANSAC

For each iteration, 3 points is choosed randomly. A homography model
* \[x^\prime_0 = \( h_{00}\quad h_{01}\quad h_{02}\)^T \(x_0\quad x_1\quad 1\)\]
* \[x^\prime_1 = \( h_{10}\quad h_{11}\quad h_{12}\)^T \(x_0\quad x_1\quad 1\)\]
